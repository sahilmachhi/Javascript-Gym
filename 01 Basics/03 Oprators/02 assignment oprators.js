// assignment oprators 

// Assignment (=): Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
let x = 5;
console.log('x:', x);

// Addition Assignment (+=): Adds 5 to the current value of y and assigns the result to y
let y = 10;
y += 5; // y is now 15
console.log('y:', y);

// Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts 8 from the current value of z and assigns the result to z
let z = 20;
z -= 8; // z is now 12
console.log('z:', z);

// Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the current value of a by 3 and assigns the result to a
let a = 4;
a *= 3; // a is now 12
console.log('a:', a);

// Division Assignment (/=): Divides the current value of b by 2 and assigns the result to b
let b = 24;
b /= 2; // b is now 12
console.log('b:', b);

// Modulus Assignment (%=): Computes the remainder when dividing the current value of c by 5 and assigns the result to c
let c = 17;
c %= 5; // c is now 2
console.log('c:', c);

// Exponentiation Assignment (**=): Raises the current value of d to the power of 3 and assigns the result to d
let d = 2;
d **= 3; // d is now 8
console.log('d:', d);
